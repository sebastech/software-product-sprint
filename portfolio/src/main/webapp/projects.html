            Getting popular classes can be a pain sometimes,
            because they tend to fill up very quickly.  And if 
            the student isn't ready to pounce the moment 
            a spot opens up, the spot gets taken.  To alleviate this
            issue, I wrote a Python script using Selenium that 
            emails you when a class is open. You can take a look at the code <a href="https://github.com/sebastech/class_monitor/blob/master/main.py">here</a>

            Music is really cool.  For my "pianduino" project,
            I, with a couple other team members, decided to 
            use an Arduino, tactile push-bottons, and a bunch of C code
            to create an electronic piano.  The piano would be able 
            to record what you just playedy, and then upon the press of the 
            "play back" button, play it back to you.  My responsbilitity for this
            team project was to write the software.  This C code had 
            to handle how long the button was pressed, which button (music note)
            it was, playing the notes to the speaker, among other things.  
            It was a fun project to build!  You can take a look at the code <a href="https://github.com/sebastech/pianduino/blob/master/pianduino.c">here</a>
