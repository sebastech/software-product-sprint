        <p> Hi, my name is Sebatian Lopez.
            I attend the University of Southern California,
            where I'm majorin in Computer Science!  I'm 
            originally from Los Angeles, and I enjoy the sunny weather.
            Some of my hobbies include: playing guitar, playing basketball,
            and coding things like this portfolio.  I also enjoy sci-fi media,
            from TV shows to books to audiobooks.  Looking forward to future SPS
            projects!
        </p>
